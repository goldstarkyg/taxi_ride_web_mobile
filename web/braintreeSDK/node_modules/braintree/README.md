## Overview

This is a Node.js library for integrating with the [Braintree](http://www.braintreepayments.com) gateway.

## Please Note
> **The Payment Card Industry (PCI) Council has [mandated](http://blog.pcisecuritystandards.org/migrating-from-ssl-and-early-tls) that early versions of TLS be retired from service.  All organizations that handle credit card information are required to comply with this standard. As part of this obligation, Braintree is updating its services to require TLS 1.2 for all HTTPS connections. Braintree will also require HTTP/1.1 for all connections. Please see our [technical documentation](https://github.com/paypal/tls-update) for more information.**

## Installation

* `npm install braintree`
* `var braintree = require('braintree')`

## Quick Start
```javascript
var util = require('util'),
    braintree = require('braintree');

var gateway = braintree.connect({
  environment: braintree.Environment.Sandbox,
  merchantId: 'your_merchant_id',
  publicKey: 'your_public_key',
  privateKey: 'your_private_key'
});

gateway.transaction.sale({
  amount: '5.00',
  paymentMethodNonce: "nonce-from-the-client",
  options: {
    submitForSettlement: true
  }
},
  function(err, result) {
    if (result) {
      if (result.success) {
        console.log("Transaction ID: " + result.transaction.id)
      } else {
        console.log(result.message)
      }
    } else {
      console.log(err)
    }
});
```
## Tests

The unit specs can be run by anyone on any system, but the integration specs are meant to be run against a local development server of our gateway code. These integration specs are not meant for public consumption and will likely fail if run on your system. To run unit tests use rake (`rake test:unit`) or npm (`npm test`).
